# Autism-Spectrum-Prediction
Welcome to the Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction in Adults Project!

## Project Overview 
This project centers around a dataset comprising survey responses from individuals who have filled out an application form. The dataset includes labels indicating whether or not each person has received a diagnosis of autism.

Our primary goal is to leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to create models capable of accurately predicting the likelihood of ASD based on the provided features. By doing so, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of ASD through quantitative analysis and predictive modeling.
